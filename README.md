* This project focuses on eateries in Kathmandu. What if the tourists love to visit the restaurants that serves Chinese food? The objective of this campaign is to promote Nepal's culture, traditions and natural beauty to the world by calling foreign visitors to explore Nepal.

* Here, I have used location data from Foursquare. I retrieved location data of the restaurants of Kathmandu that serves mainly Chinese food. The goal of the project is to find the restaurants that serves mainly Chinese food in Kathmandu. The conversion of address of place to latitude and longitude will provide specific data. The place "Thamel" is chosen because it lies in heart of Kathmandu city and hottest spot for tourism.

* Any five Chinese food serving restaurants was selected and visualized in bar graph. The bar graph represents the restaurants with distance from Thamel, a touristâ€™s hub in Kathmandu. The distances are in meters. 

* This project will help to identify Chinese restaurants in Kathmandu where the visitors may find difficulty to find eateries that serves authentic Chinese food in such busiest and crowded city of Nepal; Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, especially in Thamel areas, the visitors can get into many local food serving restaurants with continental and other varieties of cuisines.
